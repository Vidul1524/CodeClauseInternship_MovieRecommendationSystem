## 🍿Types of Recommendation systems:

#### 1) Content-Based Recommendation System
Utilizes a user's prior content choices to recommend movies and series with similar themes. For example, if a user has previously watched space-related content, the system suggests movies and series within the space and sci-fi genre.

#### 2) Collaborative Filtering
Groups individuals with similar viewing patterns to recommend content that aligns with their interests. This prediction is based on past ratings and preferences, and there are two types: User-based and Item-based systems.

#### 3) Popularity-Based Recommendation System
Recommends trending movies and series based on their current popularity. For instance, platforms like Netflix showcase a list of the top 10 movies on their homepage, with popularity determined by factors such as the number of views, viewership, and engagement. Popularity is influenced by various aspects, including the content, actors, directors, and more.
